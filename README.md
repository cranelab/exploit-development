            *   In this presentation I'll present a series of unusual security bugs. Things that I've ran into at some point and went "There's gotta be some security consequence here". None of these are really a secret, and most of them are even documented somewhere. But apparently most people don't seem to know about them. What you'll see in this presentation is a list of bugs and then some explanation of how these could be exploited somehow. Some of the things I'll be talking about are (recursive) stack overflow, NULL pointer dereferences, regular expressions and more.

    *   We show that on both the x86 and ARM architectures it is possible to mount return-oriented programming attacks without using return instructions. Our attacks instead make use of certain instruction sequences that behave like a return, which occur with sufficient frequency in large libraries on (x86) Linux and (ARM) Android to allow creation of Turing-complete gadget sets. Because they do not make use of return instructions, our new attacks have negative implications for several recently proposed classes of defense against return-oriented programming: those that detect the too-frequent use of returns in the instruction stream; those that detect violations of the last-in, first-out invariant normally maintained for the return-address stack; and those that modify compilers to produce code that avoids the return instruction.

#### Blind ROP

*   [Blind Return Oriented Programming (BROP)](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~sorbo/brop/)
    *   The BROP attack makes it possible to write exploits without possessing the target's binary. It requires a stack overflow and a service that restarts after a crash. Based on whether a service crashes or not (i.e., connection closes or stays open), the BROP attack is able to construct a full remote exploit that leads to a shell. The BROP attack remotely leaks enough gadgets to perform the write system call, after which the binary is transferred from memory to the attacker's socket. Following that, a standard ROP attack can be carried out. Apart from attacking proprietary services, BROP is very useful in targeting open-source software for which the particular binary used is not public (e.g., installed from source setups, Gentoo boxes, etc.). The attack completes within 4,000 requests (within minutes) when tested against a toy proprietary service, and real vulnerabilities in nginx and MySQL.

    *   This video tutorial illustrates how to exploit an application vulnerable to buffer overflow under a modern 2.6 Linux kernel with ASLR, bypassing stack layer randomization by search a `jmp *%esp` inside the executable file and forcing our program to jump there.
*   [Exploiting A Buffer Overflow Under Linux Kernel 2.6 With Aslr Through Ret2reg](http://www.securitytube.net/video/236)
    *   Linux kernel versions 2.6.x implement ASLR to faexecution of arbitrary code located in the stack segment of a process. Moreover, kernel versions >= 2.6.18 also made the allocation of ld-linux.so.2 dynamic, and recent compilers also tend to avoid the generation of `jmp|call *%esp` instructions, so the use of a ret2esp technique to exploit a vulnerable application is becoming harder and harder. A way to turn around the problem is analyzing the registers situations just a while before the vulnerable code is executed: very probably one of them points to the address of the vulnerable buffer. All we have to do is searching inside the executable or a static library a ret2reg instruction, where reg is the register pointing to the vulnerable area, and use that as return address.

            *   Packed shellcode is a common deterrent against reverse engineering. Mainstream software will use it in order to protect intellectual property or prevent software cracking. Malicious binaries and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges employ packed shellcode to hide their intended functionality. However, creating these binaries is an involved process requiring significant experience with machine language. Due to the complexity of creating packed shellcode, the majority of samples are painstakingly custom-created or encoded with very simple mechanisms, such as a single byte XOR. In order to aid in the creation of packed shellcode and better understand how to reverse engineer it, I created a tool to generate samples of modular packed shellcode. During this talk, I will demonstrate the use of the shellcode creation tool and how to reverse engineer the binaries it creates. I will also demonstrate an automated process for unpacking the binaries that are created.

            *   History indicates that the security community commonly takes a divide-and-conquer approach to battling malware threats: identify the essential and inalienable components of an attack, then develop detection and prevention techniques that directly target one or more of the essential components. This abstraction is evident in much of the literature for buffer overflow attacks including, for instance, stack protection and NOP sled detection. It comes as no surprise then that we approach shellcode detection and prevention in a similar fashion. However, the common belief that components of polymorphic shellcode (e.g., the decoder) cannot reliably be hidden suggests a more implicit and broader assumption that continues to drive contemporary research: namely, that valid and complete representations of shellcode are fundamentally different in structure than benign payloads. While the first tenet of this assumption is philosoph- ically undeniable (i.e., a string of bytes is either shellcode or it is not), truth of the latter claim is less obvious if there exist encoding techniques capable of producing shellcode with features nearly indistinguishable from non-executable content. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that shellcode must conform to superficial and discernible representations. Specifically, we demonstrate a technique for automatically producing English Shellcode, transforming arbitrary shellcode into a representation that is superficially similar to English prose. The shellcode is completely self-contained - i.e., it does not require an external loader and executes as valid IA32 code)â€”and can typically be generated in under an hour on commodity hardware. Our primary objective in this paper is to promote discussion and stimulate new ideas for thinking ahead about preventive measures for tackling evolutions in code-injection attacks

                *   A common goal of payload encoders is to evade a third-party detection mechanism which is actively observing attack traffic somewhere along the route from an attacker to their target, filtering on commonly used payload instructions. The use of a payload encoder may be easily detected and blocked as well as opening up the opportunity for the payload to be decoded for further analysis. Even so-called keyed encoders utilize easily observable, recoverable, or guessable key values in their encoding algorithm, thus making decoding on-the-fly trivial once the encoding algorithm is identified. It is feasible that an active observer may make use of the inherent functionality of the decoder stub to decode the payload of a suspected exploit in order to inspect the contents of that payload and make a control decision about the network traffic. This paper presents a new method of keying an encoder which is based entirely on contextual information that is predictable or known about the target by the attacker and constructible or recoverable by the decoder stub when executed at the target. An active observer of the attack traffic however should be unable to decode the payload due to lack of the contextual keying information.

            *   This paper proposes a technique that can be used to prevent the exploitation of SEH overwrites on 32-bit Windows applications without requiring any recompilation. While Microsoft has attempted to address this attack vector through changes to the exception dispatcher and through enhanced compiler support, such as with /SAFESEH and /GS, the majority of benefits they offer are limited to image files that have been compiled to make use of the compiler enhancements. This limitation means that without all image files being compiled with these enhancements, it may still be possible to leverage an SEH overwrite to gain code execution. In particular, many third-party applications are still vulnerable to SEH overwrites even on the latest versions of Windows because they have not been recompiled to incorporate these enhancements. To that point, the technique described in this paper does not rely on any compile time support and instead can be applied at runtime to existing applications without any noticeable performance degradation. This technique is also backward compatible with all versions of Windows NT+, thus making it a viable and proactive solution for legacy installations.

            *   This paper describes a technique that can be used to bypass Windows hardware-enforced Data Execution Prevention (DEP) on default installations of Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows 2003 Server Service Pack 1\. This technique makes it possible to execute code from regions that are typically non-executable when hardware support is present, such as thread stacks and process heaps. While other techniques have been used to accomplish similar feats, such as returning into NtProtectVirtualMemory, this approach requires no direct reprotecting of memory regions, no copying of arbitrary code to other locations, and does not have issues with NULL bytes. The result is a feasible approach that can be used to easily bypass the enhancements offered by hardware-enforced DEP on Windows in a way that requires very minimal modifications to existing exploits.

            *   Description:ARM processors are growing more and more prevalent in the world; ARM itself claims that more than 20 billion chips have been shipped. Take a moment to appreciate that is about three chips for every man, woman, and child on earth. The three main topics I aim to cover are (1) how to perform a Linux system call on an ARM processor via assembly, ARM pipelining used in most modern ARM processors and how it came about, and (3) the really cool way ARM can avoid branching, even with conditional control flow. These will be explained in both code, English, and (hopefully successful) live demos using an ARM development board. The end result is to get the audience to understand how to create a simple socket program written in ARM assembly.

Despite this increased interest, there is still an apparent lack of detailed vulnerability development information for OS X. This paper will attempt to help bridge this gap by walking through the entire vulnerability development process. This process starts with vulnerability discovery and ultimately finished with a remote code execution. To help illustrate this process, a real vulnerability found in the OS X wireless device driver is used.

        *   "Rowhammer is a problem with some recent DRAM devices in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows. We tested a selection of laptops and found that a subset of them exhibited the problem. We built two working privilege escalation exploits that use this effect. One exploit uses rowhammer-induced bit flips to gain kernel privileges on x86-64 Linux when run as an unprivileged userland process. When run on a machine vulnerable to the rowhammer problem, the process was able to induce bit flips in page table entries (PTEs). It was able to use this to gain write access to its own page table, and hence gain read-write access to all of physical memory.

            *   With the introduction of Windows Vista, Microsoft has added a new form of mandatory access control to the core operating system. Internally known as "integrity levels", this new addition to the security manager allows security controls to be placed on a per-process basis. This is different from the traditional model of per-user security controls used in all prior versions of Windows NT. In this manner, integrity levels are essentially a bolt-on to the existing Windows NT security architecture. While the idea is theoretically sound, there does exist a great possibility for implementation errors with respect to how integrity levels work in practice. Integrity levels are the core of Internet Explorer Protected Mode, a new "low-rights" mode where Internet Explorer runs without permission to modify most files or registry keys. This places both Internet Explorer and integrity levels as a whole at the forefront of the computer security battle with respect to Windows Vista.

            *   Since the publication of previous bypass or circumvention techniques for Kernel Patch Protection (otherwise known as "PatchGuard"), Microsoft has continued to refine their patch protection system in an attempt to foil known bypass mechanisms. With the release of Windows Server 2008 Beta 3, and later a full-blown distribution of PatchGuard to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003 via Windows Update, Microsoft has introduced the next generation of PatchGuard to the general public ("PatchGuard 3"). As with previous updates to PatchGuard, version three represents a set of incremental changes that are designed to address perceived weaknesses and known bypass vectors in earlier versions. Additionally, PatchGuard 3 expands the set of kernel variables that are protected from unauthorized modification, eliminating several mechanisms that might be used to circumvent PatchGuard while co-existing (as opposed to disabling) it. This article describes some of the changes that have been made in PatchGuard 3\. This article also proposes several new techniques that can be used to circumvent PatchGuard's defenses. Countermeasures for these techniques are also discussed.
        *   [Subverting PatchGuard Version 2](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=28&t=sumry)
            *   Windows Vista x64 and recently hotfixed versions of the Windows Server 2003 x64 kernel contain an updated version of Microsoft's kernel-mode patch prevention technology known as PatchGuard. This new version of PatchGuard improves on the previous version in several ways, primarily dealing with attempts to increase the difficulty of bypassing PatchGuard from the perspective of an independent software vendor (ISV) deploying a driver that patches the kernel. The feature-set of PatchGuard version 2 is otherwise quite similar to PatchGuard version 1; the SSDT, IDT/GDT, various MSRs, and several kernel global function pointer variables (as well as kernel code) are guarded against unauthorized modification. This paper proposes several methods that can be used to bypass PatchGuard version 2 completely. Potential solutions to these bypass techniques are also suggested. Additionally, this paper describes a mechanism by which PatchGuard version 2 can be subverted to run custom code in place of PatchGuard's system integrity checking code, all while leaving no traces of any kernel patching or custom kernel drivers loaded in the system after PatchGuard has been subverted. This is particularly interesting from the perspective of using PatchGuard's defenses to hide kernel mode code, a goal that is (in many respects) completely contrary to what PatchGuard is designed to do.
        *   [Bypassing PatchGuard on Windows x64](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=14&t=sumry)
            *   The version of the Windows kernel that runs on the x64 platform has introduced a new feature, nicknamed PatchGuard, that is intended to prevent both malicious software and third-party vendors from modifying certain critical operating system structures. These structures include things like specific system images, the SSDT, the IDT, the GDT, and certain critical processor MSRs. This feature is intended to ensure kernel stability by preventing uncondoned behavior, such as hooking. However, it also has the side effect of preventing legitimate products from working properly. For that reason, this paper will serve as an in-depth analysis of PatchGuard's inner workings with an eye toward techniques that can be used to bypass it. Possible solutions will also be proposed for the bypass techniques that are suggested.

At the time of this writing, kernel-mode research is generally regarded as the realm of a few, but it is hoped that documents such as this one will encourage a thoughtful progression of the subject matter. To that point, this paper will describe some of the general techniques and algorithms that may be useful when implementing kernel-mode payloads. Furthermore, the anatomy of a kernel-mode payload will be broken down into four distinct units, known as payload components, and explained in detail. In the end, the reader should walk away with a concrete understanding of the way in which kernel-mode payloads operate on Windows.

   *   **Papers**
        *   [ActiveX - Active Exploitation](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=41&t=sumry)
            *   This paper provides a general introduction to the topic of understanding security vulnerabilities that affect ActiveX controls. A brief description of how ActiveX controls are exposed to Internet Explorer is given along with an analysis of three example ActiveX vulnerabilities that have been previously disclosed.
        *   [Exploiting the Otherwise Non-Exploitable on Windows](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=22&t=sumry)
            *   This paper describes a technique that can be applied in certain situations to gain arbitrary code execution through software bugs that would not otherwise be exploitable, such as NULL pointer dereferences. To facilitate this, an attacker gains control of the top-level unhandled exception filter for a process in an indirect fashion. While there has been previous work illustrating the usefulness in gaining control of the top-level unhandled exception filter, Microsoft has taken steps in XPSP2 and beyond, such as function pointer encoding, to prevent attackers from being able to overwrite and control the unhandled exception filter directly. While this security enhancement is a marked improvement, it is still possible for an attacker to gain control of the top-level unhandled exception filter by taking advantage of a design flaw in the way unhandled exception filters are chained. This approach, however, is limited by an attacker's ability to control the chaining of unhandled exception filters, such as through the loading and unloading of DLLs. This does reduce the global impact of this approach; however, there are some interesting cases where it can be immediately applied, such as with Internet Explorer.
*   **Countermeasures**
    *   [BuBBle: A Javascript Engine Level Countermeasure against Heap-Spraying Attacks](http://cd80.ca/files/bubble.pdf)
        *   Abstract. Web browsers that support a safe language such as Javascript are becoming a platform of great interest for security attacks. One such attack is a heap-spraying attack: a new kind of attack that combines the notoriously hard to reliably exploit heap-based buffer overflow with the use of an in-browser script- ing language for improved r eliability. A typical heap-s praying attack allocates a high number of objects containing the attackerâ€™s code on the heap, dramatically increasing the probability that the contents of one of these objects is executed. In this paper we present a lightweight approach that makes heap-spraying attacks in Javascript significantly harder. Our prototype, which is implemented in Firefox, has a negligible performance and memory overhead while effectively protecting against heap-spraying attacks.

        *   HyperDbg is a kernel debugger that leverages hardware-assisted virtualization. More precisely, HyperDbg is based on a minimalistic hypervisor that is installed while the system runs. Compared to traditional kernel debuggers (e.g., WinDbg, SoftIce, Rasta R0 Debugger) HyperDbg is completely transparent to the kernel and can be used to debug kernel code without the need of serial (or USB) cables. For example, HyperDbg allows to single step the execution of the kernel, even when the kernel is executing exception and interrupt handlers. Compared to traditional virtual machine based debuggers (e.g., the VMware builtin debugger), HyperDbg does not require the kernel to be run as a guest of a virtual machine, although it is as powerful.

By running these views in other TTYs, you can build a customised debugger user interface to suit your needs.
*   **Linux**
    *   [GDB - GNU Debugger](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) * GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on 'inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed. * [GDB 'exploitable' plugin](https://github.com/jfoote/exploitable) * 'exploitable' is a GDB extension that classifies Linux application bugs by severity. The extension inspects the state of a Linux application that has crashed and outputs a summary of how difficult it might be for an attacker to exploit the underlying software bug to gain control of the system. The extension can be used to prioritize bugs for software developers so that they can address the most severe ones first. The extension implements a GDB command called 'exploitable'. The command uses heuristics to describe the exploitability of the state of the application that is currently being debugged in GDB. The command is designed to be used on Linux platforms and versions of GDB that include the GDB Python API. Note that the command will not operate correctly on core file targets at this time.

It uses ctypes to wrap many Win32 API calls related to debugging, and provides a powerful abstraction layer to manipulate threads, libraries and processes, attach your script as a debugger, trace execution, hook API calls, handle events in your debugee and set breakpoints of different kinds (code, hardware and memory). Additionally it has no native code at all, making it easier to maintain or modify than other debuggers on Windows. The intended audience are QA engineers and software security auditors wishing to test or fuzz Windows applications with quickly coded Python scripts. Several ready to use tools are shipped and can be used for this purposes. Current features also include disassembling x86/x64 native code, debugging multiple processes simultaneously and produce a detailed log of application crashes, useful for fuzzing and automated testing.

### Temporal Return Address
*   [Temporal Return Addresses](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=9&t=sumry)
    *   Nearly all existing exploitation vectors depend on some knowledge of a process' address space prior to an attack in order to gain meaningful control of execution flow. In cases where this is necessary, exploit authors generally make use of static addresses that may or may not be portable between various operating system and application revisions. This fact can make exploits unreliable depending on how well researched the static addresses were at the time that the exploit was implemented. In some cases, though, it may be possible to predict and make use of certain addresses in memory that do not have static contents. This document introduces the concept of temporal addresses and describes how they can be used, under certain circumstances, to make exploitation more reliable.
*   [Automating Mimicry Attacks Using Static Binary Analysis](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec05/tech/full_papers/kruegel/kruegel_html/attack.html)
    *   Intrusion detection systems that monitor sequences of system calls have recently become more sophisticated in defining legitimate application behavior. In particular, additional information, such as the value of the program counter and the configuration of the program's call stack at each system call, has been used to achieve better characterization of program behavior. While there is common agreement that this additional information complicates the task for the attacker, it is less clear to which extent an intruder is constrained. In this paper, we present a novel technique to evade the extended detection features of state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems and reduce the task of the intruder to a traditional mimicry attack. Given a legitimate sequence of system calls, our technique allows the attacker to execute each system call in the correct execution context by obtaining and relinquishing the control of the application's execution flow through manipulation of code pointers. We have developed a static analysis tool for Intel x86 binaries that uses symbolic execution to automatically identify instructions that can be used to redirect control flow and to compute the necessary modifications to the environment of the process. We used our tool to successfully exploit three vulnerable programs and evade detection by existing state-of-the-art system call monitors. In addition, we analyzed three real-world applications to verify the general applicability of our techniques.
*   [Anti-Virus Software Gone Wrong](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=21&t=sumry)
    *   Anti-virus software is becoming more and more prevalent on end-user computers today. Many major computer vendors (such as Dell) bundle anti-virus software and other personal security suites in the default configuration of newly-sold computer systems. As a result, it is becoming increasingly important that anti-virus software be well-designed, secure by default, and interoperable with third-party applications. Software that is installed and running by default constitutes a prime target for attack and, as such, it is especially important that said software be designed with security and interoperability in mind. In particular, this article provides examples of issues found in well-known anti-virus products. These issues range from not properly validating input from an untrusted source (especially within the context of a kernel driver) to failing to conform to API contracts when hooking or implementing an intermediary between applications and the underlying APIs upon which they rely. For popular software, or software that is installed by default, errors of this sort can become a serious problem to both system stability and security. Beyond that, it can impact the ability of independent software vendors to deploy functioning software on end-user systems.
*   [Sigreturn Oriented Programming is a real Threat](https://subs.emis.de/LNI/Proceedings/Proceedings259/2077.pdf)
    *   Abstract: This paper shows that Sigreturn Oriented Programming (SROP), which consists of using calls to sigreturn to execute arbitrary code, is a pow erful method for the de velopment of exploits. This is demonstrated by developing two different kinds of SROP based exploits, one asterisk exploit which was already portrayed in the paper presenting SROP, and one novel exploit for a recently disclosed bug inthe DNS address resolution of the default GNUC library. Taking advantage of the fact, that these exploits have very few dependencies on the program being exploited, a library is implemented to automate wide parts of SROP exploit creation. This highlights the potential of SROP in respect to reusable and portable exploit code which strongly supports the conclusion of the original paper: SROP is areal threat!

Combining sophisticated techniques such as code normalization, code optimization, code slicing, SMT solver and some creative heuristic searching methods, OptiROP is able to discover desired gadgets very quickly, with much less efforts. Our tool also provides the detail semantic meaning of each gadget found, so users can easily decide how to chain their gadgets for the final shellcode.

        *   [ropa](https://github.com/orppra/ropa)
            *   ropa is a Ropper-based GUI that streamlines crafting ROP chains. It provides a cleaner interface when using Ropper as compared to the command line. It can provide a smoother workflow for crafting the rop chain in the GUI, then exporting the final chain in the desired format. For those used to using CLI, this tool may serve as a cleaner interface to filter out the relevant gadgets.
        *   [Ropper](https://github.com/sashs/ropper)
            *   You can use ropper to display information about binary files in different file formats and you can search for gadgets to build rop chains for different architectures (x86/X86_64, ARM/ARM64, MIPS/MIPS64, PowerPC). For disassembly ropper uses the awesome Capstone Framework.

        *   shadow is a jemalloc heap exploitation framework. It has been designed to be agnostic of the target application that uses jemalloc as its heap allocator (be it Android's libc, Firefox, FreeBSD's libc, standalone jemalloc, or whatever else). The current version (2.0) has been tested extensively with the following targets: Android 6 and 7 libc (ARM32 and ARM64); Firefox (x86 and x86-64) on Windows and Linux;

    *   With just about one file format bug being consistently released on a weekly basis over the past six to twelve months, one can only hope developers would look and learn. The reality of it all is unfortunate; no one cares enough. These bugs have been around for some time now, but have only recently gained media attention due to the large number of vulnerabilities being released. Researchers have been finding more elaborate and passive attack vectors for these bugs, some of which can even leverage a remote compromise.

To help set the stage, the McAfee Subscription Manager ActiveX control vulnerability, which was discovered by eEye, will be used as an example of a vulnerability that requires the implementation of a custom encoder. In particular, this vulnerability does not permit the use of uppercase characters. To help make things more interesting, the encoder described in this paper will also avoid all characters above 0x7f. This will make the encoder both UTF-8 safe and tolower safe.
